# Calculate your BMI (body mass index) using MATLAB

This project contains programming both a BMI calculator and an age calculator using inputdlg and msgbox methods.
(I will recreate the project using GUI (Graphic User Interface) method in the future.)


# What is BMI

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a factor in deciding a person's amount of body fatness. Its formula is very simple, which is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.

There are three ranges divided according to the results of BMI.

Commonly accepted BMI ranges are

Under 18.5 kg/m^2 - underweight

From above 18.5 to under 25 - healthy weight

From above 25 to under 30 - overweight

Over 30 - obese

# Age Calculator

I also included the age calculator which will determine your age up to months and days.
